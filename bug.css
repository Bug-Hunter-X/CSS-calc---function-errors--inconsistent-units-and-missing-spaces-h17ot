The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there might be issues if you use it with units inconsistently. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` is valid, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` (missing 'px' or other unit) will lead to unexpected behavior or errors.  Another case is forgetting spaces around the operators within `calc()`. `width:calc(100%-10px);` is incorrect and needs spaces like `width: calc(100% - 10px);`.
